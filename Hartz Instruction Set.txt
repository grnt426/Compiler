Higher Level Instruction Breakdown:
	- Comparing Two Numbers:
		NOT $0, $0
		ADD $0, $1, $0 (assuming the number one is stored in $1)
			Alternatively:
			ADDI $0, 1, $0 #where one is some immediate value
		ADD $0, $1, $0 (assuming the number you want to add to is now stored in $1)
		BEZ $0
	- Functions:
		- Calling:
		
			# Preserve Register Stack
			SW 	$0 	(assuming sitting at desired location for storage, also assuming any registers are needed
			ROT $0 	(assuming $0 has some value to store the next register, assuming the second register is needed)
				Alternatively:
				ROT 	(implicit rotate right by ONE)
				ROT 1 	(where one is some immediate value)
			SW	$1 	(assuming this is needed)
			
			# Load amount to rotate to function
			
			
			# Actual Call to Jump to Function
			JMP $0
		- Function:
			# Code
				...
				...
		- Returning:
		
			# Jump Back
			ROT X	
				- The amount to get to the data value stored to find the
					amount to rotate by to get back
			LW $0
			JMP $0
		
		- Cleaning Up:
			ROT Y
				- amount to return to stored register stack (assuming start is
				location return jump is stored
			LW 	$0
			ROT $0 (assuming $0 has some value to get to the position of the next register, if needed)
				Alteratively:
				ROT 	(implicit rotate right by ONE)
				ROT 1 	(where one is some immediate value)
			LW $1
